    <p>The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones.[1][failed verification] A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.</p>
